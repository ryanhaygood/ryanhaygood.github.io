I'm a fourth-year PhD student at Yale University with primary interests in industrial organization and labor economics. Specifically, I study education markets using IO models and methods, with the goal of evaluating policies designed to improve their performance and inclusiveness.

<!-- Most recently, I've been studying how studentsâ€™ college preferences interact with the evolving structure of U.S. higher education to shape economic opportunity and inequality. -->

<!--Taken as a whole, my research has addressed how various economic policies affect opportunity and inequality among students, workers, and businesses. I've explored these questions in several areas of application, spanning public finance, trade, and labor economics. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic I worked with coauthors to show that enhancing unemployment benefits to assist laid-off workers substantially boosted their income without further discouraging participation in the workforce. Through other work with coauthors at the World Bank, I've documented how import quality regulations can in some cases promote trade, while also reallocating sales to lower-income countries which may benefit especially from verifiable product quality signals.

Most recently, I have studied how the supply of U.S. colleges shapes college attendance choices, focusing on the role of the for-profit sector, which educates an especially underserved group of students. Exploiting the recent closures of multiple national for-profit chain colleges, I find causal evidence that for-profit colleges mostly draw students into higher education who otherwise would not attend college (rather than pulling students away from non-selective public colleges). This suggests that the significant decline in for-profit college supply over the last decade has resulted in many low-income and non-traditional students reducing their postsecondary attainment. On a more promising note, it implies that a better-regulated for-profit sector could meaningfully improve educational outcomes for those at the lower end of the wage distribution, thereby enhancing economic mobility.-->
