I'm a third-year PhD student at Yale University with primary interests in industrial organization and labor economics. My current work evaluates education markets using IO methods. Most recently, I've been studying how studentsâ€™ college preferences interact with the evolving structure of U.S. higher education to shape economic opportunity and inequality.
