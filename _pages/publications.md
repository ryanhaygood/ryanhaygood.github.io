## [Do For-Profit Colleges Pull Students into Higher Education or away from Better Schools? Evidence from Campus Closures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ROwqxrVfhLD1AY_yogxxONKnLT9zgUib/view?usp=sharing) (November 2023; *working paper*)

**Abstract:** Despite efforts to reduce barriers to college attainment among under-represented students, gaps in later-stage human capital investment remain a key contributor to income inequality and intergenerational income persistence. While U.S. for-profit colleges primarily educate economically disadvantaged students, they yield lower average returns than public colleges. Thus, whether for-profit colleges expand access to higher education or divert enrollment from better schools determines how they influence economic mobility. I answer this question quasi-experimentally by tracking college enrollment before and after for-profit college closures. Since college exit decisions are endogenous, I exploit the abrupt closures of hundreds of campuses belonging to several national for-profit chains, comparing enrollment responses in markets with different baseline levels of chain-campus enrollment. I find that total local college enrollment declines approximately one-for-one with the size of for-profit closures, with public-sector substitution estimated to be just 10-20%, indicating that the for-profit sector indeed draws new students into higher education.

## [Quality Regulation Creates and Reallocates Trade](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/569bb37f-8508-4515-9d78-99eaa17dd94e/content) (November 2023, with Zavala et al.; *under review*)

**Abstract:** Quality regulation has become the dominant instrument of trade policy. Panel evidence shows that regulations classified as sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade both increase trade on average. Other non-tariff measures like quotas decrease trade. Sanitary and phytosanitary measures reallocate trade from lower-income exporting countries to higher-income exporting countries, while technical barriers to trade measures do the opposite. Sanitary and phytosanitary and technical barriers to trade measures increase the sales concentration of exporting firms from lower-income countries, but do not affect the concentration of exporting firms from higher-income countries or importing firms. The costs of quality regulation are primarily borne by exporting firms, especially in lower-income countries.

## [Employment effects of unemployment insurance generosity during the pandemic](https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/documents/30228/CARES-UI_identification_vF(1).pdf) (July 2020, with Altonji et al.)

**Abstract:** The CARES Act expanded unemployment insurance (UI) benefits by providing a $600 weekly payment in addition to state unemployment benefits. Most workers thus became eligible to receive unemployment benefits that exceed their weekly wages. It has been hypothesized that such high benefits encourage employers to lay off workers and discourage workers from returning to work. In this note, we test whether changes in UI benefit generosity are associated with decreased employment, both at the onset of the benefits expansion and as businesses look to reopen. We use weekly data from Homebase, a private firm that provides scheduling and time clock software to small businesses, which allows us to exploit high-frequency changes in state and federal policies to understand how firms and workers respond to policy changes in real time. Additionally, we benchmark our results from the Homebase data to employment outcomes in the Current Population Survey (CPS). We find that that the workers who experienced larger increases in UI generosity did not experience larger declines in employment when the benefits expansion went into effect. Additionally, we find that workers facing larger expansions in UI benefits have returned to their previous jobs over time at similar rates as others. We find no evidence that more generous benefits disincentivized work either at the onset of the expansion or as firms looked to return to business over time. In future research, it will be important to assess whether the same results hold when states move to reopen, and to analyze the effects of high UI replacement rates on reallocation of labor both within and across firms.
