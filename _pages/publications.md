## [Do For-Profit Colleges Expand Access to Higher Education? Evidence from Campus Closures](https://github.com/ryanhaygood/ryanhaygood.github.io/blob/master/_drafts/241106_draft.pdf) (November 2023; *working paper*)

**Abstract:** For-profit colleges educate especially poor and non-traditional students, yet they cost more and yield lower wage gains than public colleges. To evaluate how the for-profit sector shapes economic opportunity, then, it is critical to understand whether these schools expand access to higher education or simply divert students away from public schools. I estimate the rate of substitution across sectors by tracking changes in first-time college enrollment before and after for-profit college closures. Since college exit decisions are endogenous, I focus on the abrupt, nationwide closures of 462 for-profit campuses owned by 11 large chains, leveraging spatial variation in market shares to identify substitution rates to other sectors. Though prior studies conclude that for-profit and public colleges are highly substitutable, I find contrary results using newer data: rates of substitution to public colleges are around 20%, and for-profit closures precipitate large declines in local college enrollment. In evaluating mechanisms, I show that substitution rates are much higher in the minority of counties where public colleges specialize in fields of study similar to those offered by the for-profit sector. Auxiliary evidence from a large community-college grant program further substantiates the hypothesis of differentiation on program offerings. On the whole, my findings show that the for-profit sector does not simply divert students from better colleges, but indeed draws new students into higher education, partly due to its distinctive vocation-oriented programs.

## [Quality Regulation Creates and Reallocates Trade](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/569bb37f-8508-4515-9d78-99eaa17dd94e/content) (November 2023, with Zavala et al.; *working paper*)

**Abstract:** Quality regulation has become the dominant instrument of trade policy. Panel evidence shows that regulations classified as sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade both increase trade on average. Other non-tariff measures like quotas decrease trade. Sanitary and phytosanitary measures reallocate trade from lower-income exporting countries to higher-income exporting countries, while technical barriers to trade measures do the opposite. Sanitary and phytosanitary and technical barriers to trade measures increase the sales concentration of exporting firms from lower-income countries, but do not affect the concentration of exporting firms from higher-income countries or importing firms. The costs of quality regulation are primarily borne by exporting firms, especially in lower-income countries.

## [Employment effects of unemployment insurance generosity during the pandemic](https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/documents/30228/CARES-UI_identification_vF(1).pdf) (July 2020, with Altonji et al.)

**Abstract:** The CARES Act expanded unemployment insurance (UI) benefits by providing a $600 weekly payment in addition to state unemployment benefits. Most workers thus became eligible to receive unemployment benefits that exceed their weekly wages. It has been hypothesized that such high benefits encourage employers to lay off workers and discourage workers from returning to work. In this note, we test whether changes in UI benefit generosity are associated with decreased employment, both at the onset of the benefits expansion and as businesses look to reopen. We use weekly data from Homebase, a private firm that provides scheduling and time clock software to small businesses, which allows us to exploit high-frequency changes in state and federal policies to understand how firms and workers respond to policy changes in real time. Additionally, we benchmark our results from the Homebase data to employment outcomes in the Current Population Survey (CPS). We find that that the workers who experienced larger increases in UI generosity did not experience larger declines in employment when the benefits expansion went into effect. Additionally, we find that workers facing larger expansions in UI benefits have returned to their previous jobs over time at similar rates as others. We find no evidence that more generous benefits disincentivized work either at the onset of the expansion or as firms looked to return to business over time. In future research, it will be important to assess whether the same results hold when states move to reopen, and to analyze the effects of high UI replacement rates on reallocation of labor both within and across firms.
